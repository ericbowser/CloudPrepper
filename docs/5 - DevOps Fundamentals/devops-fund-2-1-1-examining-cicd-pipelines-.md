# 2-1-1: Examining CI/CD Pipelines

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Identify and explain the significance of a CI/CD pipeline in DevOps environments, given a scenario.

**Description:** In this episode, the learner will examine a CI/CD pipeline and its significance to DevOps environments. We will explore continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment, automation, feedback loops, and more.

+ Describe a CI/CD pipeline
  + A series of steps followed by software teams to deliver updates and improvements to software applications automatically and frequently. 
  + CI/CD pipeline represents the backbone of modern DevOps practices, promoting a culture of high velocity and high-quality software development and release
+ Describe continuous integration or the CI in CI/CD
  + A practice involving automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project several times a day.  
+ Describe continuous delivery or the CD in CI/CD
  + Extends the concept of CI by automatically deploying all code changes to the testing environment after the build stage.
+ Describe what a workflow is within a CI/CD pipeline
  + A series of automated steps that streamline software development from code creation to deployment
  + It starts with code being pushed to a version control system, triggering the pipeline. Automated builds and tests ensure code quality and functionality.
  + Once validated, the code is merged into the main branch and deployed to testing environments for further checks. 
  + Finally, the code is deployed to production, where it is continuously monitored to ensure performance and reliability.
  + This process reduces human error, enhances software quality, and speeds up the delivery of updates to users.
+ Describe the common steps in a typical CI/CD process
  + CI - Pulling code from a version control system
    + Ensures that the latest code changes are tracked, peer reviewed, approved and integrated
  + CI - Running automated builds and tests to verify the code
    + Helps to catch integration errors early and improve software quality. 
  + CI - Merging validated updates back into the main branch
    + Ensures that only tested and stable code is integrated, maintaining the integrity of the main branch.. 
  + CD - Deploying code changes to the testing and after the build stage.
    +  This can ensure that new features and fixes are quickly implemented
  + CD - Deploying code changes to the production environments
    +  This can ensure that new features and fixes are quickly available to users.
  + CD - Monitoring and validating post-deployment
    + Ensures deployed changes perform as expected and allows real user feedback, verifying functionality and enabling continuous improvement.
+ Describe additional considerations for a CI/CD pipeline
  + Automation
    + At every stage, manual tasks are automated, from code integration to testing, building, and deploying. 
    + Reduces the risk of human error, speeds up production cycles, and enables more consistent and reliable outcomes.
  + Feedback loops
    + The pipeline includes monitoring tools and feedback mechanisms that alert developers if there's a failure at any stage
    + This immediate feedback is crucial for quickly addressing problems before they affect more components or users.
  + Security considerations
    + DevOps - focuses on collaboration between development and operations to streamline workflows and improve deployment speed.
    + DevSecOps - integrates security practices into the DevOps process, ensuring security is a shared responsibility and built into every stage of the pipeline, while maintaining a balance with rapid release.
    + SecDevOps -  emphasizes shifting security considerations earlier in the development process, embedding security measures from the initial design through to production. This practice focuses on security, prioritizing risk mitigation over delivery speed.
