+ Discuss the topic of disaster recovery (DR) as it applies to cloud technology  

**Description:** In this episode, you will learn about the topic of disaster recovery (DR) as it applies to cloud technology. This includes topics such as recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), host site, warm site, and cold site. 

## Disaster Recovery        

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - A Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the targeted duration within which a business process or service must be restored after a disruption or outage. It represents the maximum acceptable downtime tolerated by an organization and is typically defined in terms of hours, minutes, or seconds.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum tolerable amount of data loss measured in time before a disruption or outage. It represents the point in time to which data must be recovered after an incident, and is typically expressed in terms of minutes, hours, or days.

Hot site - A hot site is a fully operational backup facility equipped with necessary infrastructure and systems to resume business operations immediately after a disaster. It typically mirrors the primary site's computing environment and data in real-time or near-real-time, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss in the event of a disruption.

Warm site - A warm site is a backup facility that contains some of the necessary infrastructure and data required to resume business operations after a disaster, but it is not fully operational in real-time like a hot site. It requires additional setup and configuration before it can become fully functional, leading to a longer recovery time compared to a hot site.

Cold site - A cold site is a backup facility that provides only basic infrastructure such as power and physical space, with no pre-installed equipment or data. It requires substantial setup and configuration in the event of a disaster, resulting in the longest recovery time compared to hot and warm sites.
