# Database cost management

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Explain how to use database cost management service features, such as cost allocation tags and multi-account billing.
+ Use cost management tools to monitor and manage database costs.
+ Explain how to optimize database resources for meeting budget requirements.
+ Compare capacity units used to determine database costs.

## Key point 1

Amazon Web Services (AWS) cost management tools include Budgets (set up alerts), Cost Explorer (provides interactive reports), Cost and Usage Reports (provides the most detailed reports), and QuickSight (serverless business insights tool using natural language).

## Key point 2

Database capacity units, also called Aurora capacity units (ACUs), are calculated based on selected memory, related CPU allocation, and related network bandwidth allocation.

## Key point 3

Database costs can be optimized by downsizing read replicas, shutting down unused database instances, and right-sizing the remaining instances.
