# Database concepts

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Compare common database types.
+ Describe elements of database structure design.
+ Identify significant differences between popular Amazon Web Services (AWS) database services.

## Key point 1

Components of a database include a host, a database engine, and the data. Database hosting options in AWS include hosted databases, serverless databases, and in-memory databases.

## Key point 2

Relational databases hold data in tables of similar kinds of information. For example, one table might list all customers while a different table lists all products and another table lists all sales. The same kinds of information are stored for each record in the table.

## Key point 3

Non-relational databases can contain different kinds of information for each record, or can offer completely different structures for data other than tables. For example, key-value pairs list various keys for each record along with a value for that key, but there are no restrictions on which keys must be included.

## Key point 4

Relational database services include Aurora; Remote Desktop Services (RDS), which is a hosting service, not a database engine; and Redshift. DynamoDB is a key-value database service. ElastiCache provides in-memory caching for databases. Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB) is a ledger-based database.
