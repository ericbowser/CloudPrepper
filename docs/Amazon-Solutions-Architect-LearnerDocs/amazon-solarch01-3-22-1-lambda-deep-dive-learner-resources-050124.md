# Lambda deep dive

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Explain Lambda's role in supporting common workflow architectures.
+ Compare Lambda to other serverless services.
+ Select appropriate resource configurations to optimize a Lambda function's performance and cost.

## Key point 1

Lambda functions add logic to a data workflow in Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can upload or write code directly in Lambda. Choose memory, timeout, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) role options, and choose the trigger and destination. Lambda run time is limited to 15 minutes (900 seconds).

## Key point 2

Lambda is charged per request to the function and the duration of that function running. The rate is determined by allocated memory.

## Additional resources
