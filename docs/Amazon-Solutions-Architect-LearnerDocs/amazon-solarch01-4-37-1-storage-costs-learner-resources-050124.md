# Storage cost management

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Explain how to use storage cost management service features, such as cost allocation tags and multi-account billing.
+ Use cost management tools to monitor and manage storage costs.
+ Explain how to optimize storage resources for meeting budget requirements.

## Key point 1

Amazon Web Services (AWS) cost management tools include Budgets (set up alerts), Cost Explorer (provides interactive reports), Cost and Usage Reports (provides the most detailed reports), and QuickSight (serverless business insights tool using natural language).

## Key point 2

When choosing between storage types (block, file system, object, and archival), consider costs, number of connections, and latency. To optimize storage costs, eliminate or transition unneeded data (such as incomplete parts from multi-part uploads or cold buckets), and eliminate unneeded versions of data, that is, use lifecycle policies to manage versions of data.

## Key point 3

Storage access options that can reduce costs include enabling Requester Pays on S3 buckets or enabling storage class analysis.
