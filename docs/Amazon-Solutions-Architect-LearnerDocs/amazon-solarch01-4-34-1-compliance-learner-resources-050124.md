# Governance and compliance concepts

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Explain processes used to ensure compliance with government and industry security standards.
+ Describe requirements applicable to data access, data governance, data classification, and data retention.
+ Compare services that support data compliance and governance.

## Key point 1

Amazon Web Services (AWS) supports compliance with standards such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR(), and others. Data classification and retention policies can be met with configurations that inventory and label data, set specific security controls, and maintain continuous monitoring. According to AWS, "security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer."

## Key point 2

AWS Artifact provides on-demand access to AWS compliance reports, such as service organization control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certifications.

## Key point 3

AWS Audit Manager can be used to map your AWS usage across accounts to framework controls for auditing. Reports can be customized to specific frameworks, such as GDPR and PCI DSS.
