# Network cost management

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Compare cost-management tools in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
+ Explain common network service features used to monitor and manage costs.
+ Configure network routing to minimize costs.
+ Select bandwidth allocation to match device costs to project needs.

## Key point 1

AWS cost management tools include Budgets (set up alerts), Cost Explorer (provides interactive reports), Cost and Usage Reports (provides the most detailed reports), and QuickSight (serverless business insights tool using natural language).

## Key point 2

Cost optimization strategies include workload review, using only a single region or single Availability Zone when possible, using less network address translation (NAT), storing and transferring less data where possible, and using multiple accounts with customized quotas for each account's workloads.

## Key point 3

Data transfer modeling helps answer the following questions: Where does transfer occur? What does it cost? What are the benefits? How is usage changing over time? Data transfer service options include Direct Connect, virtual private networks (VPNs), CloudFront, and virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints.
