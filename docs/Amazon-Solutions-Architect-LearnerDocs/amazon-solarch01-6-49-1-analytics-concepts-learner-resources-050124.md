# Data analytics concepts

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Explain the role of data analytics in modern business processes.
+ Describe the high-level phases of data analysis.
+ Identify popular Amazon Web Services (AWS) services used for data analytics.

## Key point 1

Data analytics can answer the following kinds of questions:

+ What happened? Descriptive
+ When did it happen: Diagnostic
+ What is going to happen? Predictive
+ What should be done? Prescriptive

## Key point 2

The data analytics process requires data ingestion, data movement, data processing, and data storage. Processing data starts with organizing it and cleaning it, meaning removing duplications and errors. 

Common processes are Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL), where *Extract* is pulling data from various sources, *Transform* is cleaning and standardizing the data, and *Load* is placing the data in a new location, such as a data warehouse or repository.

Common data analytics methods include regression analysis, factor analysis, cohort analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, and time series analysis.

## Key point 3

CloudTrail logs can record user activity and application programming interface (API) usage. These logs can be used to prove compliance, improve security posture, consolidate activity records, and troubleshoot problems. By default, CloudTrail keeps records for up to 90 days.

## Key point 4

Redshift is a data warehouse service. Where a data lake stores massive volumes of raw data, a data warehouse structures and filters data from various sources to support queries and analytic processes. The provisioned option is best for predictable workloads while the serverless options is better for more variable workloads.
