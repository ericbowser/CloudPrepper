# Aurora and RDS deep dive

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Compare Amazon Aurora and Relational Database Service (RDS) as relational database services.
+ Identify configuration options to increase performance and decrease costs when deploying a database into RDS.
+ Identify the purpose of the RDS Proxy feature.

## Key point 1

RDS is a database hosting service that can support Aurora, MySQL, Oracle, and other database engines. RDS includes automatic patching and backups. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Use reserved instances for cost savings as well as stopping the database for up to seven days when it's not needed. RDS performance and availability can be improved with read replicas and multi-Availability Zone (AZ) deployment.

## Key point 2

Aurora is a relational database management system designed for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It includes push-button compute scaling of CPU and memory resources, and you can create up to 15 read replicas. Aurora is a managed service while Aurora Serverless is a serverless option with auto-start, auto-stop, and auto-scaling features.
