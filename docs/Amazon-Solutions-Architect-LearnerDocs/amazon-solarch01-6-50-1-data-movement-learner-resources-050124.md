# Data movement

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Explain data ingestion patterns and security concerns.
+ Compare data transfer services.
+ Describe challenges related to handling streaming data.
+ Given a scenario, choose services appropriate for a data streaming task.

## Key point 1

With Amazon EventBridge, you can create an event bus to receive and evaluate events.

## Key point 2

With Data Exchange, you can access third-party datasets that come from sources such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA, and the UK Met Office. These datasets are often used by data analysts, data scientists, clinical trial technicians, product managers, and portfolio managers in nearly every industry to drive data analytics, train ML models, and make data-driven decisions.

## Key point 3

Amazon Web Services (AWS) DataSync provides managed file transfer with File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS), and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to transfer workload data across a hybrid deployment. It stores data natively in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) with metadata intact.

## Key point 4

Amazon Simple Queueing Service (SQS) can transfer up to 256 kilobytes (KBs) per message.

## Key point 5

Amazon AppFlow can transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) and AWS services.

## Key point 6

AWS Data Pipeline is used to create data processing workloads.

## Key point 7

Amazon Kinesis supports real-time video and data streams to collect, store, and index data. Kinesis Data Streams ingests data at scale, includes storage, includes replay, and has real-time analytics. Kinesis Firehose only transfers data, does not store data, does not include replay functionality, and only has near-real-time analytics.

## Key point 8

Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) is a streaming data service for Apache Kafka.
