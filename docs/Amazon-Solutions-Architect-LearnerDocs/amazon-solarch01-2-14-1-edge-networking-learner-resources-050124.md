# Edge networking

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Explain the purpose of a content delivery network (CDN).
+ Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution.
+ Compare Amazon CloudFront and AWS Global Accelerator.

## Key point 1

Benefits of edge networking include reducing latency, reducing bandwidth costs, increasing availability, and improving security.

## Key point 2

CloudFront can deliver static and dynamic content to edge locations, getting your content closer to your users. It can also provide limited compute at the edge. Origin Shield helps to improve performance.

## Key point 3

In contrast, Global Accelerator optimally routes user traffic from their location, off the Internet, and onto AWS Infrastructure, and then to your resources' locations, improving the user experience by up to 60%.
