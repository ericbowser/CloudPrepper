# Compute concepts

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Compare on-premises architecture design with cloud-native architecture design.
+ Compare server compute, containers, and serverless compute services.
+ Compare various cloud migration strategies, such as lift-and-shift.

## Key point 1

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Server Migration Service (SMS) and AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) can assist with lift-and-shift migration. VMware Cloud on AWS can be used to extend or migrate an on-prem VMware deployment to AWS. Typical migration strategies include rehost, revise/replatform, repurchase/replace, refactor/rearchitect/rebuild, retain, and retire.

## Key point 2

Container clusters run on EC2 instances. The container cluster is essentially a compute farm for running tasks and services, which are collections of tasks. Containers, when designed well, eliminate single points of failure in the system architecture.

## Key point 3

Serverless compute typically relies on an event-driven architecture. Fargate and Lambda are both serverless services. Serverless also eliminates single points of failure.
