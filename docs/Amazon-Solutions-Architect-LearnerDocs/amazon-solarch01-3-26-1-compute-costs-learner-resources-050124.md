# Compute cost management

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Explain how to use compute cost management service features, such as cost allocation tags and multi-account billing.
+ Use cost management tools to monitor and manage compute costs.
+ Explain how to optimize compute resources for meeting budget requirements.

## Key point 1

Amazon Web Services (AWS) cost management tools include Budgets (set up alerts), Cost Explorer (provides interactive reports), Cost and Usage Reports (provides the most detailed reports), and QuickSight (serverless business insights tool using natural language).

## Key point 2

AWS Compute Optimizer can provide up to three instance configuration recommendations for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), and Lambda. It also considers cost differences between servers, containers, and serverless options.

## Key point 3

To use Compute Optimizer, first opt into the service. After 14 days, Compute Optimizer will present configuration options to reduce costs according to usage.
