## Key point 1

"Skills in" objectives require a deeper understanding than "Knowledge of" objectives. Especially pay close attention to the list of services given after the list of objectives. Use links provided in the notes for each episode to fill in gaps as you find your blind spots. Make sure you have the equivalent of one year's hands-on experience in a wide variety of AWS services before taking the exam.

## Key point 2

The exam consists of 50 graded questions and 15 experimental questions, although you're not told which are the graded questions. You have 130 minutes to complete the questions. Most questions are multiple choice while some questions are multiple response, meaning you have to choose two or more correct answers to get full credit on the question.

## Key point 3

Practice with practice exam questions so you can develop a good strategy for analyzing the questions. Which part of the question will you read first? How can you eliminate wrong answers? Decide how many passes through the questions will work best for you, and how you will choose which questions to mark to return to them. Manage your time carefully during the entire exam.
