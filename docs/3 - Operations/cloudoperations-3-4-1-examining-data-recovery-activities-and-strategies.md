# 3-4-1 Examining Data Recovery Activities and Strategies

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Identify and explain the significance of implementing recovery strategies, given a scenario.

**Description:** In this episode, the learner will examine common recovery methods such as in-place, point-in-time, and bare-metal recoveries. We will explore bulk and granular recovery, the significance of a Recovery Time Objective (RTO), the relationship to recovery strategies, and more.

+ Describe data recovery
  + IBM -  "the process of restoring lost, corrupted, accidentally deleted, or otherwise inaccessible data to its server, computer, mobile device, or storage device (or to a new device if the original device no longer works)."
  + Reference: https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-recovery
+ Describe common recovery methods \(or types\)
  + In-Place recovery  
    + Restores data directly over the existing production environment, replacing the original data.  
    + Pros - quick restoration, ideal for minimal downtime.  
    + Cons - risky as it can lead to data loss if the recovery fails. 
  + Parallel recovery  
    + Restores data to a secondary system that runs alongside the primary system, allowing for validation without downtime.  
    + Pros - safer, as it does not overwrite existing data.  
    + Cons - resource-intensive, requiring additional infrastructure.
  + Point-in-Time recovery  
    + Restores data to a specific moment before data loss or corruption occurs, using log data.  
    + Pros - allows precise recovery to pre-disruption state.  
    + Cons - requires comprehensive logging and can be complex to configure and execute.
  + Bare-metal recovery  
    + Rebuilds a system from the ground up, directly on new hardware, without the need for a pre-installed operating system.  
    + Pros - enables full system recovery on new, potentially diverse hardware
    + Cons - time-consuming and requires having compatible hardware available.
  + Virtual machine snapshots \(NOTE - VM snapshots are not a viable data recovery solution\)
    + Quickly reverts VMs to a previous state for fast operational recovery.  
    + Pros - extremely fast recovery times and very useful in virtualized environments.  
    + Cons - Not a full backup solution; dependent on underlying VM and storage system integrity.
+ Recovery Options  
  + Bulk
    + Restores large volumes of data at once, typically used after significant system failures.
    + Pros - effective for large-scale disasters.  
    + Cons - lacks precision, potentially wasting resources when only specific data needs recovery.  
  + Granular
    + Targets specific files, folders, or data items for restoration.  
    + Pros - efficient when only certain data pieces need recovery.  
    + Cons - time-consuming if the backup system lacks good indexing
+ Describe the relationship with recovery implementations
  - A critical factor in choosing a recovery strategy.
  + The chosen method must align with the organization's RTO to ensure business continuity. 
+ Describe a Recovery Time Objective
  + The maximum acceptable length of time that a system, application, or network can be down after a failure or disaster occurs.
+ Describe a couple of examples
  + In-place recovery
    + Might be chosen for its speed if the RTO is tight.
  + Parallel recovery 
    + Might be preferred if the RTO allows for a longer downtime but requires higher data integrity.
