# 1-2-1: Achieving Cloud Observability Using Alerting

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Identify and explain the importance of alerting to cloud observability, given a scenario.

**Description:** In this episode, the learner will examine alerts, alerting, and alerting activities, such as alert triage and response. We will explore the benefits of implementing alerting to achieve cloud observability.

+ Describe alerting and the significance of cloud observability
  + Alerting
    + The process of notifying relevant parties when predefined conditions or thresholds are met in the monitored system.
    + It involves setting up triggers based on metrics, logs, or events and sending notifications to appropriate stakeholders or systems when these triggers are activated. \(demo - show Azure Monitor Alerts - aci-cloud-demo-alert-01, administrative operations awareness\)
+ Describe alert triage and the significance of observability in the cloud
  + Alert triage - involves prioritizing and categorizing alerts generated by monitoring systems based on their urgency, severity, and impact on business operations. \(demo - show Azure Monitor Alerts severity attributes\)
  + Benefits
    + Efficient resource allocation
      + Teams can allocate resources effectively, focusing on critical issues that require immediate attention while deprioritizing less urgent alerts. 
    + Reduced noise
      + Helps to filter out noise by identifying false positives or non-actionable alerts, preventing alert fatigue among monitoring teams.
    + Improved incident response time
      + Enables teams to respond faster to critical incidents, reducing mean time to resolution \(MTTR\) and minimizing potential business impact.
+ Describe alert response and the significance of observability in the cloud
  + Response - refers to actions taken to address and resolve issues triggered by alerts, such as restarting services or escalating to the appropriate team.
+ Describe a real-world scenario for alerting in the cloud
  + Example
    + Use the Resource Visualizer interface - allowing observability across an entire solution contained within a specific resource group
    + Using the Alert feature in Azure Monitor to proactively implement monitoring and notifications systems for cloud resources in Azure
    + Purpose
      + Set up alerts
      + Define thresholds
      + Select notification channels \(SMS, email, workspace\)
      + Create and customize alerting logic
      + Monitor and respond
      + Review and optimize
      + Wash, rinse, repeat
      
## Additional Resources
+ Metric - a quantitative measurement used to track specific aspects of a cloud system, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or network traffic.
+ Log - a record of system activity, typically capturing detailed information about events, operations, and error messages.
+ Event - an occurrence or action within a cloud system, like a user request, a change in configuration, or a system warning.
+ Load - the demand placed on a cloud system, typically measured by the number of requests, processing tasks, or resource usage.
+ Trigger - a condition or Event that initiates a specific action or response in a cloud system, such as scaling, alerting, or automated workflows.
