# 1-3-1: Achieving Cloud Observability Using Tracing

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Identify and explain the importance of tracing to cloud observability, given a scenario.

**Description:** In this episode, the learner will examine tracing, tracing components, such as traces, spans, annotations, and exporters. We will explore the benefits of leveraging to achieve cloud observability.

+ Describe tracing
  + The practice of monitoring and recording information about software executions, specifically within distributed systems.
+ Describe the purpose of tracing
  + Helps in understanding the journey and behavior of requests as they flow through various services and components of cloud-based applications and infrastructure.
  + Targets the latency, failures, and overall performance of individual requests or transactions.
+ Describe the benefits of tracing to cloud observability
  + Performance optimization
    + Help identify bottlenecks in the system by providing a detailed breakdown of where time is spent in a distributed transaction.
  + Error diagnosis
    + It enables developers to pinpoint the exact service or operation where a failure occurs
    + Facilitates quicker root cause analysis
  + Service dependency analysis
    + Tracing visually represents interactions between services, helping understand dependencies and the impact of one service on another.
  + Capacity planning
    + Analyzing trace data can help organizations better understand usage patterns and plan capacity accordingly to ensure performance and scalability. \(demo resource scaling options\)
  + Improved user experience
    + Tracing can contribute to optimizing application performance and reliability by reducing downtime and slow response times.
+ Describe a real-world example of performing tracing in a cloud environment
  + Using the Performance Diagnostic feature in Azure on a cloud resource, such as a server, application, or service.
  
## Additional References

+ Traces - represents the complete lifecycle of a single user request or transaction as it traverses through the different services in a system.
+ Spans - represents a specific unit of work or operation within a service, with each trace comprised of multiple spans.
+ Annotations - metadata added to spans to provide additional details about the execution, which can include:
  + Timestamps
  + Events
  + Other key-value information 
+ Trace exporters - components that send trace data to a backend system or observability platform for storage and analysis.
