+ Discuss some of the various disk and storage types that are available in the cloud 

**Description:** In this episode, you will learn about just some of the disk and storage types available in the cloud today. This episode includes a discussion of object storage, block storage, and file storage as well as solid-state drives and hard disk drives.     

## Disk and Storage Types       

Storage types: 

+ Object storage - Object-based storage is a data storage architecture that organizes and manages data as objects, each with a unique identifier, metadata, and data, providing scalability, flexibility, and simplified management for handling vast amounts of unstructured data.
+ Block storage - Block-based storage is a data storage approach that divides data into fixed-sized blocks, typically accessed via protocols like iSCSI or Fibre Channel, allowing for direct and low-level access to storage volumes and enabling high-performance storage solutions for applications like databases and virtualization.
+ File storage - File-based storage is a data storage method where data is organized into files and directories, accessible via file protocols such as NFS or SMB, offering a hierarchical structure for storing and accessing data in a shared environment.

Disk types: 

+ Solid-state drive (SSD) - SSD is a storage device that uses flash memory technology to store data persistently, offering faster access times, lower latency, and higher reliability compared to traditional hard disk drives (HDDs).
+ Hard disk drive (HDD) - HDD is a storage device that uses rotating magnetic disks and mechanical read/write heads to store and retrieve data persistently, providing high-capacity storage at a lower cost per gigabyte compared to solid-state drives (SSDs).

Performance implications - Choosing between different cloud-based storage options such as object-based storage, block-based storage, and file-based storage can significantly impact performance, as each option offers distinct characteristics tailored to specific workload requirements. Object-based storage excels in handling large amounts of unstructured data with scalability, while block-based storage provides high-performance storage for transactional workloads, and file-based storage offers compatibility with legacy applications and file-sharing capabilities.

Cost implications - Selecting different cloud-based storage options, like object-based storage, block-based storage, and file-based storage, can influence costs based on factors such as storage capacity, data access frequency, and additional features like redundancy and data replication. Object-based storage typically offers cost-effective scalability for large volumes of data, while block-based storage may incur higher costs for provisioned storage and data transfer, and file-based storage often includes pricing based on capacity and access frequency.
