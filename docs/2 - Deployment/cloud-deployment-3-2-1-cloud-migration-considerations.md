# 3-2-1: Cloud Migration Considerations

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Identify and explain the cloud migration considerations, given a scenario

**Description:** In this episode, the learner will examine key aspects of cloud migrations to consider. We will explore cost, management overhead, service availability, compliance, and more.

+ Describe the significance or importance of cloud migration planning
  + Identify and assessing the various common technical and operational factors of the new environment can:
    + Ensure a smooth transition
    + Optimize performance
    + Mitigate risk
    + Minimize downtime
    + Improve the user experience
    + Reduce unnecessary costs
+ Describe the key aspects of cloud migrations to consider
  + Cost and management overhead
  + Platform compatibility, vendor lock-in, service availability, resources \(storage, compute, networking\)
  + Regulatory and compliance
+ Describe the considerations of each aspect
  + Cost
    + Estimate the cost of cloud resources and services, to ensure the migration and.
    + This can include
      + Aligning with budgetary constraints
      + Meeting financial objectives
      + Calculating expenditures
      + Identifying potential savings 
  + Management overhead
    + Reduce the effort required to manage cloud resources
    + This can include
      + Leveraging automation
      + Implementing continuous monitoring
      + Utilizing various cloud-based management services
  + Platform compatibility
    + Ensure that your applications and data are compatible with the target cloud platform
    + This can include:
      + Operating system
      + Middleware
      + Runtime environments
  + Vendor lock-in
    + Evaluate the degree of dependence on a specific cloud providerâ€™s technologies and services
    + Implement strategies for maintaining flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in
    + This can include:
      + Identify the current and future business objectives
      + Researching current and future service offerings
      + Provide and communicate details of findings
  + Storage
    + Evaluate data storage needs to select the most suitable storage services
    + This can include:
      + Volume
      + Storage type \(object, block, file\)
      + Access patterns \(frequent, infrequent, archival\)
      + Performance requirements \(NVMe, SSD, traditional HDD, archival\)
  + Compute
    + Choose the appropriate compute resources that match or exceed current on-premises or cloud capabilities.
    + Assess compute requirements
    + This can include:
      + CPU requirements \(vCPU, vCore, count\)
      + Memory requirements \(low-latency, general purpose, capacity\)
  + Networking
    + Plan for the networking architecture
    + This can include 
      + Bandwidth needs
      + Performance capabilities
      + Connectivity between cloud and on-premises environments
        + Internet
        + VPN
        + Direct connection
  + Service Availability
    + Evaluate the availability and redundancy of cloud services
    + Ensure business continuity and disaster recovery \(BCDR\) requirements are met
    + Research service-level agreements to determine the availability levels \(e.g. 99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99\) 
  + Regulatory
    + Identify any regulatory requirements affecting where and how data is stored and processed
    + Especially critical for industries subject to specific regulations
  + Compliance
    + Ensure that the cloud environment complies with industry standards and certifications relevant to your business
    + This can include:
      + GDPR for privacy requirements
      + HIPAA for healthcare requirements
      + PCI-DSS for credit card transactions
  + Environmental Factors:
    + Power and Cooling
      + Understand the environmental impact of migrating to the cloud
      + This can include potential reductions in on-premises power and cooling requirements or to region-specific natural disasters \(e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, tornados, hurricanes)
