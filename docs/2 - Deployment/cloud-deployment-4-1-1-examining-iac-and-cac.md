# 4-1-1: Examining IaC and CaC

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Identify and explain using code for deployment and configuration in the cloud, given a scenario. 

**Description:** In this episode, the learner will examine using code to provision and configure cloud-based resources. We will explore Infrastructure-as-Code or IaC, Configuration-as-Code or CaC, drift detection, repeatability, testing, and more.

+ Describe Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\)
  + Provisioning computing environments through text-based files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools
  + Replacing manual processes to provision computing resources
  + Benefits
    + Standardization
    + Speed
    + Consistency
    + Repeatability
+ Describe Configuration as Code \(CaC\)
  + Using text-based definition files to manage the configuration of systems
  + Configuration is measured against a desired state, such as a baseline
  + Helps to ensure configurations are applied consistently across infrastructure
  + Benefits
    + Standardization
    + Speed
    + Consistency
    + Repeatability
+ Describe the significance of repeatability:
  + The ability to consistently recreate the same immutable environment multiple times without manual intervention, crucial for minimizing variations between development and production environments
+ Describe the importance of versioning in code-based deployments
  + Versioning
    + Managing changes to configuration scripts and infrastructure setups through version control systems
  + Allows for the tracking of modifications and rollback, if necessary
  + Examples - Git, Bitbucket \(Atlassian\), AWS CodeCommit, Beanstalk
+ Describe configuration drift and drift detection:
  + Configuration drift
    + A situation in which a system, component, or element's configuration deviates from an established configuration baseline
  + Drift detection
    + Identifies and reports changes from the defined configuration baseline
    + Helps in maintaining control over infrastructure and configuration states.
  + Configuration management software - Ansible, SaltStack, Chef, Puppet, Terraform
+ Describe the importance of testing
  + Helps to ensure the environment meets the required specifications before deployment
  + Using IaC and CaC can automate the creation of the infrastructure and configuration
  + Leveraging testing automation to reduce manual intervention and optimize the deployments
+ Describe the importance of accurate and timely documentation
  + Keeping detailed records of configurations, setups, and changes to support maintenance, compliance, and future modifications
  + Follow change and configuration management policies, procedures, and guidelines

## Additional Resources
+ Example Scenarios
  + Standardized Development Environments:
    + Scenario: Leverage IaC to automate the creation of development, testing, and production environments that are identical in every aspect.
    + Benefit: Ensures consistency and reduces environment-related issues when moving applications through stages.
  + Real-Time Infrastructure Adjustment:
    + Scenario: Use CaC tools integrated with drift detection mechanisms to automatically adjust configurations in real-time, maintaining the desired state.
    + Benefit: Keeps systems secure and compliant by quickly reverting unauthorized changes.
  + Version-Controlled Infrastructure Updates:
    + Scenario: Apply versioning principles to IaC to manage changes to cloud infrastructure, allowing for controlled updates and quick rollbacks.
    + Benefit: Increases operational reliability by tracking changes and facilitating recovery if updates cause issues.
  + Automated Testing for Infrastructure Deployment:
    + Scenario: Implement automated testing protocols to validate infrastructure and configurations coded in IaC before they go live.
    + Benefit: Reduces deployment failures by catching errors early in the deployment process.
