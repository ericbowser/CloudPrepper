# 3-1-1: Examining Cloud Migration Types

After completing this episode, you should be able to:

+ Identify and explain cloud migration types, given a scenario 

**Description:** In this episode, the learner will examine various cloud migration types. We will explore "On-premise to Cloud," "Cloud to Cloud," "Cloud to On-premises," and more.

+ Describe what cloud migration
  + The strategic process of moving digital assets such as data, applications, and IT processes between on-premises data centers, cloud environments, or from one cloud platform to another
  + Migration strategies enhance efficiency, scalability, and flexibility, tailored to business needs and compliance
+ Describe common cloud migration strategies
  + On-premises to Cloud
    + Moving assets from local data centers to the cloud
    + Considerations
      + Enhances scalability and flexibility
      + Can reduce costs
      + Allows integration of advanced cloud services, such as serverless computing, for improved efficiency
    + Examples: Betabrand, Spotify
  + Cloud to On-premises 
    + Transferring assets from the cloud back to on-premises data centers.
    + Considerations
      + Cloud-based tools facilitate smooth data transfers back to on-premises, ensuring data integrity and minimizing transition downtime.
    + Example: Dropbox \(note - technically a hybrid migration, reducing dependency on AWS, regaining greater control over their storage\)
  + Cloud-to-Cloud 
    + Shifting assets from one cloud environment to another.
    + Considerations
      + Utilizes inter-cloud services and APIs for efficient migration, with benefits like reduced data transfer costs and enhanced security.
    + Examples: GitLab, Shopify, Waze \(Waze is technically a cloud to multi-cloud migration\)
+ Describe some practical considerations for cloud migrations
  + On-premises to Cloud
    + Best for scalability and innovation, improving disaster recovery, and data analytics capabilities
  + Cloud to On-premises
    + Targeting compliance or control needs, useful for data or application repatriation.
  + Cloud to Cloud
    + Optimizes resources by leveraging different cloud providers' strengths, suitable for achieving cost savings, compliance, or accessing specialized services.
+ Describe the significance of understanding cloud migrations
  + Can help organizations navigate digital transformation effectively
  + Offers scalability, resilience, and efficiency, aligning IT operations with business goals.
+ Simulation-Based Scenarios for Migration Types
  + Scenario 1: On-premises to Cloud Migration for a Financial Services Firm
    + Objective
      + Migrate a financial services firm's customer data and transaction processing systems from on-premises servers to a cloud environment
      + Enhance scalability
      + Introduce advanced analytics capabilities
    + Tasks
      + Evaluate and select the appropriate cloud service model (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS).
      + Plan data migration while ensuring compliance with financial regulations.
      + Implement and test the cloud environment before full migration.
      + Monitor the migration process for issues, ensuring minimal downtime.
    + Cloud Benefit: Utilizes the cloud's scalability and advanced services for real-time transaction processing and analytics while ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.
  + Scenario 2: Cloud-to-On-premises Migration for a Healthcare Application
    + Objective
      + Meet new data sovereignty regulations.
      + Move a healthcare application and its sensitive patient data from a public cloud environment back to on-premises infrastructure
    + Tasks
      + Ensure the on-premises infrastructure meets the necessary security and compliance standards.
      + Plan a phased migration to minimize service disruption.
      + Validate data integrity and application functionality post-migration.
    + Cloud considerations
      + Implement cloud-based data transfer tools to efficiently synchronize and migrate large volumes of sensitive data securely
  + Scenario 3: Cloud-to-Cloud Migration for an E-commerce Platform
    + Objective
      + Transition an existing e-commerce platform from one cloud service provider to another to capitalize
      + Implement enhanced AI/ML capabilities for personalized shopping experiences provided by the new CSP
    + Tasks
      + Assess and compare the offerings and capabilities of both cloud providers.
      + Design a migration strategy that includes 
        + Data and storage transfer
        + Application re-deployment
        + Testing
        + Minimal downtime.
      + Execute the migration, ensuring seamless service continuity for users.
    + Cloud considerations
      + Implement inter-cloud connectivity and data transfer services for a smooth transition
      + Leveraging the target cloud's AI/ML services for enhanced customer experiences
