# TestPrepper Cloud+ Study Application

## Application Features
- **Question Bank**: Database of Cloud+ practice questions organized by domain
- **Progress Tracking**: User performance analytics and weak area identification
- **Study Sessions**: Timed practice exams and flashcard modes
- **AI-Powered Explanations**: Natural language explanations for answers
- **Social Features**: Study groups and discussion forums

## Cloud Architecture Design

### Compute Resources
**Frontend**: 
- React SPA deployed on CDN (CloudFront/Azure CDN)
- Serverless functions for API endpoints (AWS Lambda/Azure Functions)

**Backend Services** (Microservices Architecture):
- **Question Service**: Manages question bank and categories
- **User Service**: Authentication, profiles, progress tracking
- **Analytics Service**: Performance metrics and reporting
- **AI Service**: Generates explanations using cloud AI APIs

### Data Storage Strategy
**Hot Tier**: User sessions, active question sets (SSD block storage)
**Warm Tier**: User progress history (standard storage)
**Cold Tier**: Question analytics, logs (infrequent access)
**Archive Tier**: Backup data, compliance logs

### Database Selection
- **Primary**: Managed relational DB (RDS/Azure SQL) for user data
- **Cache**: Redis/ElastiCache for session management
- **Analytics**: Time-series database for performance metrics
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for question search functionality

### Network Architecture
**VPC Design**:
- Public subnets: Load balancers, CDN origins
- Private subnets: Application servers, databases
- Database subnets: Isolated data tier

**Security**:
- Application Gateway with WAF
- Network Load Balancer for high availability
- Private connectivity between services

### CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Pipeline
stages:
  - Code Review (Pull Requests)
  - Automated Testing
  - Security Scanning
  - Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)
  - Application Deployment
  - Monitoring Setup
```

### Cost Optimization
**Billing Models to Leverage**:
- Spot instances for batch processing (question imports)
- Reserved instances for steady-state services
- Pay-as-you-go for development environments
- Resource tagging for cost allocation by feature

### Disaster Recovery Strategy
**Multi-Region Setup**:
- RTO: 15 minutes (Warm site approach)
- RPO: 5 minutes (Real-time replication)
- Automated failover using health checks

### DevOps Integration
**Version Control**: Git with feature branching
**Monitoring**: ELK stack for logging, Grafana for metrics
**Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container management
**IaC**: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
