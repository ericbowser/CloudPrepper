## What is the Shared Responsibility Model?

**Shared responsibility model** - The shared responsibility model in cloud computing delineates the responsibilities between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer in terms of security and management of resources.

*   In this model, the CSP is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure, including physical data centers, networking, and hypervisors, as well as ensuring the availability and reliability of the cloud services.
*   On the other hand, the customer is responsible for securing their data, applications, identities, and configurations within the cloud environment.
    *   This entails tasks such as configuring access controls, implementing encryption, managing user permissions, and securing application code. Essentially, while the CSP manages the security of the cloud infrastructure, the customer is accountable for securing their data and applications within that infrastructure, forming a collaborative approach to ensuring overall security and compliance in the cloud.
